## The idea

The idea is to take a Ribba ([Black](https://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/p/ribba-fotolijst-zwart-40378401/) or [white](https://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/p/ribba-fotolijst-wit-00378403/)<sub><sup>, Shamone!</sup></sub>) and repurpose it as a WordClock. We'll use a cutting plotter on self adhesive vinyl to cut the words and icons. The design is a bit different from most other WordClocks in that it includes a few icons which can be assigned for any purpose. The design includes:

- An alarmclock - as an indicator an alarm is set for example
- A heart - as a seconds-indicator (make it 'pulse' red to give it a heartbeat feel) or maybe you make it light up on Valentine's day?
- A party popper - have it light up at all the birthdays in your family or on New Year's eve or...
- A bell - to indicate you have new e-mail or to remind of you something (make it flash!) or...
- A WiFi symbol - we can make it light up blue for connecting, red for errors or problems, green for 'everything OK' and maybe yellow for NTP syncing. Or anything else we want...

Because we use RGB leds any of the indicators can have multiple functions, as do the letters by the way, by combining color, flashing or 'pulsing' and other effects. Because we have 115 "pixels" available that we can make pretty much any color we can do a whole lot with this "display" other than have it display the time. Think of rainbow or 'matrix' effects, playing snake, or tetris, on it with your phone as a controller, displaying an analogue clock using the "pixels", have it display the roomtemperature or even the local weather... We're only limited by the restrictions of the microcontroller, what is possible in software and what we can display on the 'screen'. And that sounds restrictive but having WiFi and, thus, internect connectivity we can do a LOT and are mostly bound by our own imagination.

## Parts

- A Ribba (see [the idea](#the-idea))
- A [Wemos D1 mini](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32651747570.html) (or a NodeMCU, ESP32, Raspberry pi)
- At least 2 meters (115 LEDs minimum) of [60 LED/m WS2812B LED strip](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2036819167.html) (IP30 will do)
- A [5V DC power supply](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000364274787.html) capable of delivering _at least_ 7A or more; I can recommend the LRS-50-5
- A [Power supply cable](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000390134327.html)

According to the specs, a WS2812B draws 18W per meter at 60 LEDs per meter. That's 18W / 60LEDs = 0.3W per LED. That's 0.3W / 5V = 0.06A per LED. Given 115 LED's (10 rows of 11 LEDs + 5 status LEDs) we'll need at least 6.9A + some for the microcontroller and optional other parts.

It's generally recommended to 'inject power' every 2.5 feet or every 75 cm so we won't have 'yellowing' at the end of the LED strip and also won't be overloading our wiring.

Since, normally, we won't be driving all LEDs at the same time at full brightness we do have some headroom in both the specs of the power supply and the power injection. You'll probably get along just fine with a 3A power supply and injecting power only at the beginning of the strip; however we like to err on the safe side, especially since we don't know what other uses we can think of for our clock in the future which might require lighting more, or even all, LEDs or driving additional circuitry as well.

In normal operation about 20~25 LEDs will be on at the same time, which should draw about 1.5A max. Only in the very worst case scenario will we need the full 7A. However, we _designed_ this clock to be able to handle this (should we add functionality other than displaying the time, requiring more/all LEDs to be lit). Because of this it is also important to use at least 0.82mm² / 18 AWG wire at minimum to provide power to the LED strip. A short strip of the power cable could be used for that purpose.

### Optional parts

To improve the circuit or to add additional features:

- [A breadboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32256273855.html) to help out during the build
- [D1 Protoboard shield](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32790791836.html) to put all components on
- [5 Spade terminal connectors](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32985520928.html) to hook up the powersupply (better than clamping the wire, but still optional) *
- [A short length of 0.82mm² / 18 AWG wire](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000037800462.html) to provide power to the LED strip, 50 cm should be more than sufficient
- [Heatshrink](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32788409697.html) to properly isolate your wire solderjoints
- [Projectbox](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32889586884.html) to put the microcontroller and other components in
- [A 470Ω resistor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32847047012.html) to current-limit the signal pin to the LED strip
- [Some 1000μF electrolytic capacitors](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32909080992.html) with a voltage rating at least 5V if your LED strip doesn't have built-in capacitors **
- [10 pairs of 3pin SM JST connector male/female for WS2812B LED Strip](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1718558728.html)
- [An LDR](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32760631393.html) with a [A 10KΩ resistor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32847047012.html) or [light sensor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32550638947.html) to have the clock auto-adjust brightness
- [DHT22](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32802908424.html) to give your clock another purpose: temperature / humidity sensor
- [Power switch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32832214619.html) or [inline power switch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32907410798.html); not required (you can simply unplug) but neat
- [A buzzer](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32849730395.html) to give your clock an alarm function

\* Make sure you order the correct size for the terminal screws on your powersupply. For M3.5 screws order SV 1.25-3.5 if you can, else round up to SV 1.25-4

** If your LEDstrip has no 'smoothing' capacitors 'built-in', you should consider putting one of them at every point where the power is injected into the strip. The 470Ω resistor is used for current limiting the data pin. If you opt for an LDR you'll need the 10KΩ resistor for a voltage divider.

## FAQ

* **This thing burnt my house down! Who do I sue?**<br>
So sorry 'bout that. I hope you and your family are OK. **However**, this project is entirely at your own risk. Use your own judgement. I am **not** an electrical engineer; I'm a hobbyist at best. Also **always** make sure you unplug before working on the electrical components of the clock and use proper precautions. All I can say is that mine hasn't burst into flames (yet) and that I did my best to have enough tolerances in the design where appropriate. Also: make sure you buy a quality powersupply!
* **Do I have to order everything over at AliExpress?**<br>
Ofcourse not! It's just where I order most of my (cheap) parts. You can order equivalent parts anywhere you like!
